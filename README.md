<h3> 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me </h3>

- 🎓 I hold a Bachelor of Science in Physics, where my passion for unraveling the mysteries of the physical world was ignited. However, my journey has taken an exciting turn as I embark on the path to becoming a software developer by studying the Foundations of Computer Science at SE Factory. I'm eager to explore the endless possibilities of the digital realm and turn my curiosity into code.

- 🛠️ I thrive on creating things. Whether it's crafting elegant lines of code, strumming my guitar to create harmonious melodies, conquering virtual worlds in video games, or putting brush to canvas and bringing my imagination to life through painting, the act of creation is at the heart of who I am.
